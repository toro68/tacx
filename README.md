# Auuki
Auuki is a powerful, no-nonsense app built for hammering out **structured workouts** on a smart trainer, right in your browser. No installs, no dependencies, no slow updates taking from precious training time.

**Key Features**:
* Run Zwift **.ZWO workouts**
* Connect via **Bluetooth** to smart trainers, power meters, heart rate monitors, the moxy monitor, and many more
* Full control with **ERG mode**, **Grade Simulation**, and **Resistance mode**
* Workouts with **Slope-based targets** for realistic effort control
* Record **.FIT activities** in a cross-industry standard
* Recording of native **RR intervals** in the .FIT file
* Built-in structured workouts to get you started
* **Intervals.icu and Strava** integrations for seamless syncing and uploads

Built as a **progressive web app (PWA)**, Auuki is fully browser-based and runs independently. It makes use of some of the most advanced Browser APIs like: Web Bluetooth, Web Serial, and Web Components. The web version is **free and open-source**, keeping everything on your device.
Train anywhere, with full control directly in your browser.

_Status_: Currently working on creating a full suite of Apple platform native apps (iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS).

### ANT+

Support for ANT+ is experimental at the moment. It is being rewritten right now and the code is moved to [WebANT](https://github.com/dvmarinoff/WebANT), which has a separate demo. When it becomes stable enough will be merged here. It currently has support for Ubuntu(Linux), and partially for MacOS, and Android. Windows 10 may be possible in the future.


The current development setup is using Suunto movestick mini, Garmin Fenix 5 watch broadcasting heart rate,
Tacx Heart Rate monitor, Tacx Flux S trainer, and X240 laptop with Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS, M1 Mac, and Samsung S9 Android phone.
